    <p>
      Kenelle Moore is a self taught mixed media resin artist originally from Philadelphia, PA and raised in Laurel, MD. She has lived in many states but in 2019 her transition from Portland, OR back to the east coast was the most difficult after a series of unfortunate events. In hopes of finding a form of self care and therapy she discovered her love for resin art!

    <h3 class="h3headings">What is Resin Art?</h3>
    <p>
      "Resin art is created when a runny chemical called epoxy resin is combined with various color pigments and additives to produce a blend of unique patterns and textures. The resin mixture gradually hardens (when mixed with a hardener) to a solid plastic as a chemical reaction between its components takes place." - Wasted Talent Inc.
